        <h1>I don't like poems</h1>
        
        <p><em>Poems</em>, they look so <strong>simple</strong> <br> yet so <strong>difficult</strong> to understand.</p>
        <p>They are difficult to make <br> even if it looks so simple.</p>
        <p>Poems are known to have rythem <br> but most I read doesn't have any rythem.</p>
        <p><em>I dont like making poems</em><br> or any poems in general.<br> They are <strong>confusing</strong> <br> and I don't want to send time <em>decoding</em> like some sort of archeologist.<br> I like to keep things clear and simple <br><em>is that so hard to ask?</em></p>
